== Chisel Facades ==
This is a mod for Minecraft 1.6.4 that adds blocks from [Chisel](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1288400-chisel) as [BuildCraft](http://www.mod-buildcraft.com/) Facades.

It's still very much a work in progress while I figure out how to make Minecraft mods properly.

=== Building ===
Put CHISEL-1.6.4-1.5.2.jar in the libs folder and run `gradlew build`. (Doesn't work yet)

=== Running ===
To run in your development environment after building, you'll need AutoUtils, BuildCraft and CodeChickenCore (for automatic de/reobfuscation) in your mods folder.

To run in a release environment, you'll need the mod itself, Chisel, AutoUtils and BuildCraft in your mods folder. CodeChickenCore shouldn't be required.
